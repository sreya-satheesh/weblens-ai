# WebLens AI

WebLens AI is a web app that lets you turn any image into text you can edit. It also gives you smart tools to quickly summarize, translate, rewrite, or proofread that text—making it easy to turn pictures into useful content right away.

## Problem & Solution

Every day we come across text hidden inside images—like screenshots, articles, or social media posts. 
Typing it out by hand takes time and effort. 
WebLens AI makes this easy with a one-click tool that pulls out the text and helps you edit, summarize, translate, or refine it. With fast, private, and affordable AI running right on your device, it turns images into content you can actually use.

-   **Summarization:** Condenses long text into concise key points using the **Summarizer API**.
-   **Translation:** Translates extracted text into multiple languages using the **Translator API**.
-   **Rewriting:** Adapts the tone of text for professional, casual, or academic styles using the **Rewriter API**.
-   **Proofreading:** Refines grammar and improves readability with the **Proofreader API**.
-   **Clean and Responsive UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI, it supports both light and dark modes for a great user experience.
