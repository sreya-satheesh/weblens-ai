# WebLens AI

WebLens AI is a web application built for the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge. It turns images into editable text and provides a suite of AI-powered tools to summarize, translate, rewrite, and proofread the extracted content, enabling users to turn visual information into actionable content instantly.

## Problem & Solution

In our daily digital lives, we constantly encounter text locked within imagesâ€”screenshots, articles, or social media posts. Manually transcribing this text is slow and inefficient. WebLens AI solves this problem by providing a seamless, one-click solution to extract, refine, and repurpose this content. By leveraging powerful on-device AI, it offers a private, fast, and cost-effective way to make visual information fully accessible and editable.

-   **Translation:** Translates extracted text into multiple languages using the **Translator API**.
-   **Rewriting:** Adapts the tone of text for professional, casual, or academic styles using the **Rewriter API**.
-   **Proofreading:** Refines grammar and improves readability with the **Proofreader API**.
